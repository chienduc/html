        <p>We know how it goes. Sometimes, no matter how much you love the design, it may not perfectly fit your space.</p>

        <p>That's why we offer a 30-Days Return Policy:</p>

        <p>1) This means you have a full 30 days from the date of delivery to determine whether or not a new item is a perfect fit for your space. If you decide for any reason you are completely unsatisfied, contact us at help@castlery.com or +65 67445333 so we can facilitate the return.</p>

        <p>2) All return item has to be unused and in perfect condition in its original state. If item is found with defect(s), we will reject the return.</p>

        <p>3) Shipping is a hard cost we incur from our logistics partners. If you decide to return the item, a restocking fee will be charged at per item 20% of the orginal invoiced value. As such, you be refunded the following: Purchase Price - Restocking Fee = Refunded Amount (S$)</p>

        <p>4) Our Logistics team will contact you to schedule for the collection. We will only perform the refund after we collect the returned item and customer's refund details. All refunds will take 14 days to process and we will issue in the form of a credit back to the original method of payment. However, Castlery reserves the rights to change the mode of refund.</p>

        <p>5) The 30-Day Return Policy is non-applicable to items marked as "Final Sale", "Display Item" & "Customized Order".</p>

        <p>Any cancellation after 48 hours from date of purchase will be subject to a cancellation fee of S$50 per item valued at equivalent or above S$500 and 5% per item valued below S$500. This means we will refund you the invoiced amount less cancellation fee.</p>
